# TODO: Recreate TodoList Backend and Ensure Functionality

## Plan Overview
Recreate the entire backend from scratch to ensure it works properly, then rebuild frontend if needed.

## Steps
- [x] Set up database by running dbactividades.sql
- [x] Recreate dbconexion.php with proper PDO connection
- [x] Recreate consultas.php with fixed CRUD methods for activities
- [x] Recreate user.php with login/register functionality
- [x] Recreate endpoint.php with corrected API routing and parameters
- [x] Test backend endpoints for functionality
- [ ] Recreate frontend if backend works

## Key Changes
1. Fix typos in endpoint parameters (e.g., "mostar" to "mostrar")
2. Ensure proper session handling and JSON responses
3. Clean code structure for maintainability
4. Test all CRUD operations and auth
